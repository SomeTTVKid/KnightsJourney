// LOOK INTO MORE EFFECIENT GARBAGE CLEANUP system
// TODO Possibly create a vector for items that have their states turned off
// Then we would loop through deleting all the pointers in that vector
// Would need to update our shit once again, turning all raw pointers in scene to unique_ptr
// Then in update, we would check state and either update or std::move to the garbage collection vector
// Then at the end of update, we would call a function to clear that vector if it wasnt empty

// TODO Make MAIN_MENU fade in, then start playing audio and listening to inputs

// TODO Next audio is enemy sounds :D

// TODO Revamp dialogue menu artwork and layout :D

// TODO Could always redo our entity class to be more like projectiles and items
// We would have to redo our player, npc, and enemy class BUT we could end up making prefabs...
// Would be a lot of work but something to think about

// TODO Maybe a skin selection which could set states for buffs/debuffs?

// TODO create a function for items called useConsumable
// Switch case inside this function on the ID of the item
// If health, do health checks and increase player health
// If mana, do above for mana
// Do a check of the item count to see if item.second - 1 <= 0
// if it is, remove the item from inventory
// Delete the item pointer once its out of inventory
// If not just decrement item.second

// TODO Work on interacting with the inventory
// Think about how we can draw weapons

// TODO Create a floating damage number system 
// When dealing or taking damage, temporarily draw the number above the entity that took damage
// Reuse code for doing interact text :D

// TODO Fix knockback ignoring collision checks lol, 
// Certainly something weird happening here...might need to fix how we resolve collisions
// Maybe a shunt mechanic is finally called for

// TODO Quest system
//		   int,      			bool		   std::string,   std::string,      Item
// Quest(questID, questState(Active/NotActive), questName, questDescription, questReward)
// Probably need another header file like levelstates and g_vars for this

// TODO Save system
// LOOK AT BRAINROT GAME
// Using nholman create a save and load system
// Make new pointer in SceneManager called m_LastScene;
// When loading game or loading last save, return player to m_LastScene

// TODO Add in a permanenet resource manager class, loads all our static member variables for us

// TODO create more artwork for flora, npcs, and structures
// Artwork for fencing for the map borders?
// Artwork for the shore scene
//	including: Water, Ship, Dock, NPC, and enemy or two for later

// TODO think of how we can continue from dying
// Would make sense to save the last scene the player was in
// Give two options after death, QUIT or LAST SAVE
// Change the scene BACK to previous scene and reset other variables

// TODO add in weapons that rotate around the player
// Weapons need a collisionbox as well
// Should be able to rotate 180 degrees around the player on each side

// TODO add in other UI features

// TODO Change our id section so its actually working as collision layers :D..maybe...NAH this can also be removed :D

// TODO perhaps have ids tied to what objects can and cant be interacted with OR remove this all together, Probably this
// Basically making a shit small ecs
// If the id is npc and e is clicked then we play dialogue
// If the id is a scene switcher we switch the scenes 
// If the id is a chest or container we open and retrieve whats insids
